Welcome to the practical and advanced course on Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)! This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks designed to take you from fundamentals to advanced techniques in AI agent development with ADK.

## üéØ What is Google ADK?

Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. It enables building systems where multiple agents collaborate, using any AI model (Gemini, Claude, GPT, Llama, etc.) and offering integrated tools for common tasks.

## üìö Course Content

This course is structured in several modules, each focused on a key aspect of ADK:

1. **Module 1: Introduction to ADK**
   * Fundamental concepts of ADK.
   * Key advantages and why to use it.
   * Installation and environment setup.
   * Main components: Agents, Tools, Runners, and Sessions.
   * Creating your first functional agent with Google search.
   * Using `adk web` and `adk run` to interact with agents.

2. **Module 2: Advanced LLM Management**
   * Model flexibility with **LiteLLM**: Integration of Claude, GPT, Llama, and others.
   * Fine-tuning LLM behavior with parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, `max_output_tokens`).
   * Generating **structured output** using Pydantic for predictable and validated JSON responses.
   * Practical examples comparing different models and configurations.

3. **Module 3: Mastering Tools**
   * Concept and importance of Tools in ADK.
   * Using **pre-built tools**:
     * `google_search`: For up-to-date information search.
     * `BuiltInCodeExecutor`: For secure execution of Python code generated by the LLM.
   * Creating **custom tools**:
     * Defining functions with type hints and descriptive docstrings.
     * Examples: Calculator, Product Search, Percentage Calculation.
   * **Best practices** for designing effective tools.
   * Advanced use cases:
     * Stateful tools with context (e.g., shopping cart).
     * Combining multiple tools in a specialized agent (e.g., e-commerce agent).

4. **Module 4: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration**
   * Introduction to **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Standard protocol for connecting AI systems with external data sources.
   * Configuration and use of **MCP servers** with ADK.
   * Practical implementation of different MCP types:
     * **MCP Folder**: File and directory access and manipulation.
     * **MCP Twitter**: Social media integration for analysis and content.
     * **MCP Maps**: Geolocation and mapping services.
     * **MCP E-commerce**: Product, inventory, and transaction management.
   * Creating **custom MCP servers** for specific use cases.
   * Practical examples of agents consuming data from multiple MCP sources.

5. **Module 5: Advanced Workflows with ADK**
   * Design and implementation of **complex workflows** using multiple agents.
   * Execution patterns:
     * **Sequential Agent**: Sequential execution of tasks with dependencies.
     * **Parallel Agent**: Parallel processing to optimize performance.
     * **Loop Agent**: Automatic iteration and refinement of results.
   * **Agent orchestration**: Coordination and communication between multiple specialized agents.
   * Handling **shared states** and **persistent context** between agents.
   * Advanced use cases: Data processing pipelines, decision-making systems, and complex automation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* Basic Python knowledge.
* Fundamental understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs).
* Google account (to run on Google Colab).
* **API Keys** for the models you want to use (Google AI Studio, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alarcon7a/google-adk-course
   cd google-adk-course
   ```

2. **Option A: Run on Google Colab (Recommended for beginners):**
   * Click the "Open in Colab" button at the top of this README.
   * Open each notebook (`.ipynb`) individually in Colab.
   * Follow the instructions within each notebook to install dependencies and configure API Keys.

3. **Option B: Run Locally:**
   * **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
     ```bash
     python -m venv adk-env
     source adk-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: adk-env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * **Install base dependencies:**
     ```bash
     pip install google-adk==1.4.2 litellm==1.73.0 python-dotenv pydantic jupyter
     ```
     *Note: Each notebook may require additional package installations.*
   * **Configure your API Keys:**
     * Create a `.env` file in the project root (you can copy from `.env.example` if provided).
     * Add your API Keys to the `.env` file:
       ```env
       GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
       OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
       ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
       # For Azure OpenAI
       # AZURE_API_KEY="your_azure_api_key"
       # AZURE_API_BASE="your_azure_endpoint"
       # AZURE_API_VERSION="your_api_version"
       ```
   * **Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:**
     ```bash
     jupyter lab
     # or
     jupyter notebook
     # or
     # Any trusted IDE
     ```
   * Open the notebooks (`.ipynb`) and follow the instructions.
   * Remember to also follow the .py files with `adk web` or `adk run`

## üîë Key Concepts Covered

* `LlmAgent`: The central component for creating LLM-based agents.
* `LiteLlm`: For using a wide variety of language models.
* `google_search`: Pre-built tool for Google searches.
* `BuiltInCodeExecutor`: For secure Python code execution.
* **Custom Tools**: Decorated Python functions or simply passed as a list to the agent.
